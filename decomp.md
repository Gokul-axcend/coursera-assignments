Question 2
Which of the following could be an approach to Decomposition? Select all that apply.

1 point

A. Start with a smaller version of the problem and build up to the original problem.


B. Break the problem into smaller problems by thinking about what inputs are needed to solve the problem and how to use those inputs to perform a task.


C. Break the problem into a number of discrete sub-tasks by figuring out what steps are needed to solve the problem.


D. Test out a few examples to see if a pattern emerges.

Question 3


You have been asked to organize a local food drive, during which canned goods are collected and distributed to people in need. Which of these is an example of how this problem could be decomposed? Select all that apply.

1 point

A. Determine the food drive coverage radius by identifying and prioritizing areas of need and where food collection bins should be, then coordinate with local businesses to set up these points.


B. Determine the details of how canned goods are to be collected, and how they are to be distributed.


C. Identify the logistical tasks, for instance, selecting the dates and locations of collection bins, publicizing the drive dates and locations, obtaining and setting up collection bins, determining the outreach channels, and distributing donations to those channels.


D. Determine what institutions have the best track record of distributing food, when they will need the most food, and what type of food is most needed.
